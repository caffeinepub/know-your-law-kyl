# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build the “Know Your Law (KYL)” legal awareness app with clear navigation and structured educational content on mediation, key legislation, and mediation scenarios.

**Planned changes:**
- Create the core information architecture with a responsive navigation UI for three top-level sections: About Mediation, Legislative Knowledge, and Scenarios where mediation will take place, each with internal sub-section navigation.
- Implement “About Mediation” with 4 named sub-sections and structured English content (headings + bullet points) for each.
- Implement “Legislative Knowledge” with 3 named sub-sections and a consistent “Key Features” list layout for each act, including the provided Mediation Act, 2023 key features and authored key features for the other two acts.
- Implement “Scenarios where mediation will take place” with exactly 5 distinct scenario sub-sections, each containing a clearly labeled “Scenario” and “How mediation resolves it” step-by-step block.
- Apply a cohesive visual theme suitable for legal education that avoids a blue-and-purple primary palette and maintains consistent typography, spacing, and components.
- Add and display required static assets: KYL logo in the header and a hero/banner illustration on the landing/overview area, loaded from static files.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate a mobile/desktop-friendly KYL app to read structured mediation education, review key features of three relevant acts, and explore five mediation scenarios with step-by-step resolution guidance, all within a consistent themed UI with KYL branding imagery.
